**Note: Rev 1.0 has been [prototyped by Amon_RA on twitter](https://twitter.com/Amon_RA/status/1220659582181224448 "The tweets"). Thank you so much! The Rev 1.0 had a grounded READ pin near the top edge. To find it look at the 74LS32 closest to the CPU, pin 8. If you have Rev 1.0, cut this trace betwen pin8 and GND at top edge.

I would also like to thank the work by lvr for the schematics draft he posted in [a forum64.de thread](https://www.forum64.de/index.php?thread/73757-the-final-chesscard/&postID=1139564#post1139564 "A draft of the schematics for TheFinalChessCart"). With this schematic I was able to match my gerbers against a netlist generated from his schematics, and in this way the error in Rev 1.0 was easy to spot. The draft was very close to the layout. Thanks also to [@thilographie_de](https://twitter.com/thilographie_de) for hunting the error with me.

## Change log

* 2020-01-25 Rev 1.1:
  * pin 8 "READ" on 74LS32 (near CPU) was grounded. Removed GND.
  * A trace stopped too early before a via. Still connected. Fixed.
* 2019-12-31 Rev 1.0: Touched up traces on a finer grid. 45degree bends.
* shown in video: traced up. quick 90 degree bends
